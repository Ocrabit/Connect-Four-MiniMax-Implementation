# Connect Four MiniMax Implementation

Description:  <br>
	This is a connect four project where I implemented arrays and a minimax algorithm that has a selection method which scores board states up to three turns in advance and compares them to choose the best option. It also filters with alpha beta pruning to not waste calculations on useless paths. The connect four game I built is a little different as you can choose any position on a 6x7 board. The issue that I came upon is one of quantity. By expanding the depth we get vastly more board states to calculate a ranking for. So I worked with alpha beta pruning which cuts off pathways that will not lead to a winning score, reducing extra problems and increasing efficiency.
